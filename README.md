# labTwo_Elowen

Some of the pictures are from Midjourney </br>
The social media icons in the footer are from [icon8](https://icons8.com)</br>
The class .visually-hidden did I get from [a11yproject.com](https://www.a11yproject.com/posts/how-to-hide-content/)</br>
Most of the text about Elowen comes from chatGpt and it's a fiktiv project.</br>
I took inspiration from [Coding2Go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8smiWQ8Seg&t=55s) when I did the sidebar in the navigation in mobile
I saw how to make a collapsible from [w3schools.com] (https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_collapsible.asp)
